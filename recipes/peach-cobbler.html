    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This peach cobbler is a staple for late summer/early fall peach season. I
      make it every year with local Colorado peaches from Palisade. The recipe
      is simple and delicious. All it takes is 8 ingredients!
    </p>

      As Pinch of Yum creator, Lindsay, says, this dessert is "the BEST peach
      cobbler! Made with fresh peaches, sugar, and a topping that bakes like
      underbaked cookie dough, with cruchy sugar broiled on top." DROOLING!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Peach Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5-6 large <strong>fresh yellow peaches</strong>, sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup <strong>sugar</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup <strong>salted butter</strong>, melted</li>
      <li>3/4 cup <strong>sugar</strong></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <strong>vanilla</strong></li>
      <li>1 cup <strong>flour</strong></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <strong>baking powder</strong></li>
      <li>a pinch of <strong>salt</strong></li>
      <li>1/4 cup <strong>turbinado sugar</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>whipped cream</strong> or <strong>vanilla ice cream</strong> for
        serving
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Smear the bottom of 9x13 pan with butter.
        Add peaches and sugar, and mix directly in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the butter, sugar, vanilla, flour, baking powder, and salt until a
        cookie-dough-like batter forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place scoops of the mixture over the top of the peaches. Spread with a
        spoon or with your fingers - no need for perfection here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 30 minutes. At this point it should be juicy and bubbly around
        the sides - if not, pour two tablespoons of melted butter over the
        peaches during the last 5 minutes of baking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the top with turbinado sugar. Bake another 10 minutes and then
        finish with a few minutes under the broiler for a few minutes to get it
        golden brown and slightly cruchy on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        To get a thick saucy peach base, let it stand for 20-30 minutes before
        serving with some vanilla ice cream. But good luck with that.ðŸ˜…
