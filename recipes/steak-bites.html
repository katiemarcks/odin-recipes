    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This an incredibly tasty, perfectly easy, 5-ingredient recipe! These take
      minutes prep and minutes to cook and the simple marinade gives them so
      much flavor. Itâ€™s a dinner recipe everyone can agree on!
    </p>
    <p>
      I love this recipe because all you need for the marinade is honey, soy
      sauce and garlic. Simple ingredients yet big flavor! Steak is cut into
      perfect bite size pieces, marinated, then quickly pan seared for nicely
      browned steak on the outside and medium cooked, juicy steak on the inside.
      Then for an easy side serve it with baked potatoes or rice and steamed
      veggies.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.5 lbs sirloin steak, fat trimmed, diced into cubes just under 1-inch
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp honey</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 Tbsp)</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Green onions or sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place steak pieces in a gallon size resealable bag.</li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl whisk together soy sauce, honey and garlic. Pour over
        steak, seal bag while pressing out excess air then rub marinade over
        steak.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to refrigerator and let marinate 1 - 2 hours.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a heavy non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove half the steak from marinade, transfer to skillet (spaced apart)
        and let sear until golden brown, about 1 minute then flip to opposite
        side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let continue to cook to desired doneness, about 1 minute longer
        (internal safe temperature is 145 degrees). Transfer to a plate and
        repeat with remaining steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm garnished with green onions or sesame seeds if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
